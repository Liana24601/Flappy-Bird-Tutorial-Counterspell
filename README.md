# flappy bird tutorial counterspell

I was an orgnazer during Counterspell so to pass the time I just followed a tutorial and built a Flappy Bird game.
It was orginally meant to be a platformer but i decided I've made too many of those and wanted to try something new.
I know its a little laggy but hope you like it!!
